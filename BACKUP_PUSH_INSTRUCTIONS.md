## Summary

This backup preserves the state of the main branch as of 2025-10-12. The backup consists of:

- **Local Git Branch**: A branch named `bak-20251012` that points to the main branch
- **Local Git Tag**: A tag named `bak-20251012` that marks this specific commit
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive backup documentation and usage instructions
- **Automation**: A script for creating future backups automatically

### What Has Been Completed

✅ Backup branch created locally
✅ Backup tag created locally  
✅ Comprehensive documentation added
✅ Automated backup script created
✅ All changes committed to the repository

### What Requires Manual Action

⚠️ Push the backup branch to remote: `git push origin bak-20251012`
⚠️ Push the backup tag to remote: `git push origin tag bak-20251012`

These manual steps are required because the automated system does not have direct push access for creating new branches and tags on the remote repository.

## Future Backups

For future backups, simply run:

```bash
./scripts/backup-main-branch.sh
```

This will automatically:
- Fetch the latest main branch
- Create a new backup with the current date
- Generate documentation
- Provide instructions for pushing to remote
