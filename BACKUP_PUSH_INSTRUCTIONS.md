## Local Backup Status

✅ Backup tag created: `bak-20251012`

## Required Manual Steps

Since the automated system cannot push branches and tags directly, the following manual steps are required to complete the backup:

### 1. Push the Backup Branch

```bash
git push origin bak-20251012
```

This will push the backup branch to the remote repository, making it accessible to all team members.

### 2. Push the Backup Tag

```bash
git push origin bak-20251012
```

This will push the backup tag to the remote repository.

### 3. Verify the Backup

After pushing, verify the backup is available:

```bash
# Check remote branches
git ls-remote origin bak-20251012

# Check remote tags
git ls-remote --tags origin bak-20251012
```

## Alternative: Using GitHub Web Interface

If you prefer to use the GitHub web interface:

1. Go to https://github.com/qaiu/vxcore/branches
2. Click "New branch"
3. Enter branch name: `bak-20251012`
4. Select source: `main`
5. Click "Create branch"

## Verification

Once pushed, the backup will be visible at:

- Branch: https://github.com/qaiu/vxcore/tree/bak-20251012
- Tag: https://github.com/qaiu/vxcore/releases/tag/bak-20251012

## Notes

- The backup is currently created locally in this repository
- The backup documentation has been committed to the repository
- The actual branch and tag need to be pushed manually to complete the backup process
